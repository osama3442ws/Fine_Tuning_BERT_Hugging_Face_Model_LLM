**Fine-Tuning a BERT-Based Uncased Hugging Face Model on the Kaggle Hate Speech Dataset**

I successfully fine-tuned a BERT-based uncased model from the Hugging Face library on the Kaggle Hate Speech dataset. This involved pre-processing the dataset, setting up the model and training parameters, and optimizing the model to accurately classify hate speech. The project demonstrates the application of advanced NLP techniques to address the critical issue of online hate speech, leveraging state-of-the-art transformer-based models for improved performance and accuracy.

**Summary of the Code :**

This code demonstrates how to fine-tune a BERT-based model using TensorFlow and the Hugging Face library for a text classification task. The specific task involves classifying tweets from the Kaggle Hate Speech dataset into three categories: Hate Speech, Offensive Language, and Neither.

1. Import Necessary Librarie.

2. Load the Dataset
    *Load the dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
    *Display the first few rows of the dataset.
   
3. Visualize Data Distribution
    *Plot the distribution of classes using Seaborn.
   
4. Clean the Data
   *Remove Twitter handles from the tweets.
   
5. Convert Data to Hugging Face Dataset Format
   *Convert the Pandas DataFrame to a Hugging Face Dataset.
   
6. Split the Dataset
   *Split the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
   
7. Tokenization
   *Initialize a tokenizer and tokenize the dataset.
   
9. Prepare TensorFlow Datasets
   *Convert the tokenized datasets to TensorFlow format.
   
11. Initialize and Train the Model
   *Initialize the BERT model for sequence classification and train it.
    
13. Visualize Training Results
   *Plot the training accuracy and loss.
    
15. Evaluate the Model
   *Evaluate the model on the test dataset.
    
17. Make Predictions
   *Make predictions on sample sentences and display the results.

**This summary outlines the steps taken in the code to load and preprocess the dataset, tokenize the text data, fine-tune a BERT model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new data.**
