# Fine_Tuning_BERT_Hugging_Face_Model_LLM
I successfully fine-tuned a BERT-based uncased model from the Hugging Face library on the Kaggle Hate Speech dataset. This involved pre-processing the dataset, setting up the model and training parameters, and optimizing the model to accurately classify hate speech. The project demonstrates the application of advanced NLP techniques
